// You are a college student and you want to stream a movie over one of the campus’s Wi-Fi networks. Based on the number of users, some networks won’t have the data to stream a movie.

// Use the following Network class to track how much total data and how many users each network has:

// class Network {
//   constructor(data, users) {
//     this.data = data;
//     this.users = users;
//   }
// }
// The properties of the Network class are:

// data: Total units of data supplied by the network
// users: Total numbers of users currently on the network
// Each user on average deducts 5 units from the network’s total data. To watch a movie you must connect to a network that has at least 10 remaining units of data.

// Add a method movieTime() to the Network class that returns true if there is enough data available to watch a movie, false if there isn’t.

// Example:

// const library = new Network(50, 9) 
// library.movieTime() // returns false

class Network {
  constructor(data, users) {
    this.data = data;
    this.users = users;
  }
  // Insert code below
  movieTime(){
    const drawdown = this.users * 5;
    const totalDrawdown= this.data - drawdown;
    const result = totalDrawdown >= 10  ? true : false;
    return result;
  }
}

const library = new Network(50, 9) 
console.log(library.movieTime()) // returns false
