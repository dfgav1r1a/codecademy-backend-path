Now itâ€™s time to create a game! Program this code to dribble the ball on the platform using any key on a keyboard. When a user presses a key down, it should lift the ball up. When the user releases the key, the ball should drop.

First, make a function named up() that will raise the .bottom position of the ball to '250px'.

Create an event handler property that runs the down() function when a keyup event fires on the document.

Run your code and play around with the keyboard events to make the ball bounce on the platform. You can try keys like the space bar, letter keys, or number keys!
